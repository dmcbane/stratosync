# Installation

This guide takes you from a clean Linux system to a mounted cloud drive. If you already have rclone configured, skip to step 2.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why | How to install |
|-------------|-----|----------------|
| **Linux with FUSE3** | The daemon mounts via FUSE3. | `sudo apt install fuse3` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo dnf install fuse3` (Fedora) |
| **rclone** | Backend for every cloud provider. | [rclone.org/install](https://rclone.org/install/) |
| **Rust 1.80+** | Only required if building from source. | `rustup update stable` |
| **libfuse3-dev** | Only required if building from source. | `sudo apt install libfuse3-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo dnf install fuse3-devel` (Fedora) |

Stratosync ships pre-built packages for **x86_64** and **ARM64** Linux. If you're on one of those, prefer the package install; the source path is for unsupported platforms or development.

---

## 1. Configure rclone

Stratosync uses [rclone](https://rclone.org/) for every backend operation. You need a working rclone remote before stratosync can mount it.

```bash
rclone config
```

Follow the interactive prompts. Provider-specific guides:

- [Google Drive](https://rclone.org/drive/)
- [OneDrive](https://rclone.org/onedrive/)
- [Dropbox](https://rclone.org/dropbox/)
- [Amazon S3](https://rclone.org/s3/)
- [Nextcloud / WebDAV](https://rclone.org/webdav/)
- [Full provider list](https://rclone.org/overview/)

Verify the remote works before continuing:

```bash
rclone lsd <remote_name>:    # list top-level directories
rclone about <remote_name>:  # show storage quota
```

> **Multiple accounts of the same provider** (e.g. personal + work Google Drive)
> are configured as two distinct rclone remotes — `gdrive-personal` and
> `gdrive-work` — and then two `[[mount]]` blocks in stratosync. Per-mount
> isolation is total: separate database, cache directory, OAuth token, and
> upload queue. No daemon-side flag is needed.

---

## 2. Install stratosync

### Option A: Pre-built packages (recommended)

Replace `0.12.0` with the [latest release version](https://github.com/dmcbane/stratosync/releases/latest) and `amd64`/`x86_64` with `arm64`/`aarch64` for ARM:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
curl -LO https://github.com/dmcbane/stratosync/releases/latest/download/stratosync_0.12.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i stratosync_0.12.0_amd64.deb

# Fedora / RHEL
curl -LO https://github.com/dmcbane/stratosync/releases/latest/download/stratosync-0.12.0-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo dnf install ./stratosync-0.12.0-1.x86_64.rpm

# Arch Linux (AUR)
yay -S stratosync-git

# Any distro (tarball)
curl -LO https://github.com/dmcbane/stratosync/releases/latest/download/stratosync-0.12.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzf stratosync-0.12.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo cp stratosync-0.12.0-linux-x86_64/stratosync* /usr/local/bin/
```

### Option B: Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmcbane/stratosync
cd stratosync
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` builds the workspace in release mode, copies `stratosyncd` (daemon) and `stratosync` (CLI) to `~/.local/bin/`, drops a default config at `~/.config/stratosync/config.toml`, and enables a `stratosyncd` systemd user service.

For a manual build:

```bash
cargo build --release --workspace
install -m 755 target/release/stratosyncd      ~/.local/bin/
install -m 755 target/release/stratosync       ~/.local/bin/
install -m 755 target/release/stratosync-tray  ~/.local/bin/    # optional: system tray
```

### Optional: file-manager integrations

`install.sh` and the prebuilt packages drop the right files for each
desktop's file manager. **Emblem support** is GTK-only today; **context-
menu actions** (Pin, Unpin, Resolve conflict) are available everywhere.

| File manager | Desktop | Emblems | Actions | Loader needed |
|--------------|---------|:-------:|:-------:|---------------|
| Nautilus | GNOME | yes | yes | `python3-nautilus` |
| Nemo | Cinnamon | yes | yes | `python3-nemo` |
| Caja | MATE | yes | yes | `python3-caja` |
| Dolphin / Konqueror | KDE | yes | yes | KF6 KIO at runtime (separate subpackage) |
| PCManFM / PCManFM-Qt | LXDE / LXQt | — | yes | none |
| Thunar | XFCE | — | yes | none (manual UCA merge) |

The GTK trio's emblems read directly from the `user.stratosync.status`
xattr the FUSE layer exposes, so there is no daemon round-trip — they
update within one poll cycle of any status change. Actions everywhere
shell out to the `stratosync` CLI through the shared
`stratosync-fm-action` wrapper, which detaches via `setsid` so your
file manager never blocks.

System tray indicator: run `stratosync-tray` (built alongside the CLI;
autostart `.desktop` shipped in packages).

#### Manual installation (without the installer)

GTK-family — copy the helper and the per-FM file:

```bash
# Nautilus (Nemo and Caja paths analogous)
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions
cp contrib/file-managers/common/stratosync_fm_common.py    ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/
cp contrib/file-managers/nautilus/stratosync_nautilus.py   ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/
nautilus -q
```

Dolphin / Konqueror — single ServiceMenu file (context-menu actions):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kio/servicemenus
install -m 755 contrib/file-managers/dolphin/stratosync.desktop \
    ~/.local/share/kio/servicemenus/
# Restart Dolphin
```

Dolphin / Konqueror emblem-overlay plugin (KF6 C++) — opt-in, separate
build. Needs `cmake`, `extra-cmake-modules`, `qt6-base-dev`, `libkf6kio-dev`
(or the equivalent Fedora/Arch packages — see
[`overlay-plugin/README.md`](../contrib/file-managers/dolphin/overlay-plugin/README.md)):

```bash
cd contrib/file-managers/dolphin/overlay-plugin
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build           # system-wide
# OR per-user:
cmake -B build -S . \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local \
    -DKDE_INSTALL_PLUGINDIR=$HOME/.local/lib/qt6/plugins
cmake --build build && cmake --install build
```

`install.sh` does this automatically when `kf6-kio-devel` /
`libkf6kio-dev` is present; skips silently otherwise. The `.deb`/`.rpm`
ship a separate `stratosync-dolphin-overlay` package — install only on
KDE.

PCManFM / PCManFM-Qt — five action files:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/file-manager/actions
cp contrib/file-managers/pcmanfm/stratosync-*.desktop \
    ~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/
# Restart PCManFM
```

Thunar — manual merge required. See
[`contrib/file-managers/thunar/README.md`](../contrib/file-managers/thunar/README.md)
for the snippet and merge instructions; do not just overwrite an
existing `~/.config/Thunar/uca.xml`.

The action wrapper `stratosync-fm-action` is what every declarative
menu calls; the project installer puts it in `~/.local/bin/` alongside
`stratosync` and `stratosyncd`.

---

## 3. Configure a mount

Edit `~/.config/stratosync/config.toml`:

```toml
[daemon]
log_level = "info"

[[mount]]
name          = "gdrive"             # unique per mount; used for the per-mount DB
remote        = "gdrive:/"           # rclone remote and path (from step 1)
mount_path    = "~/GoogleDrive"      # where files appear in your filesystem
cache_quota   = "10 GiB"             # max local cache size
poll_interval = "30s"                # how often to check for remote changes
enabled       = true
```

Add as many `[[mount]]` blocks as you want — one per cloud account. Optional per-mount fields you'll likely care about:

- `ignore_patterns = ["*.tmp", "node_modules/**"]` — selective sync (see [usage guide](usage.md#selective-sync)).
- `upload_window = "22:00-06:00"` — only upload at night.
- `version_retention = 10` — keep N file versions for rollback.

The full set is documented in **[architecture/08-config.md](architecture/08-config.md)**.

Test the configuration before starting the daemon:

```bash
stratosync config test
```

This verifies that every enabled mount's rclone remote is reachable.

---

## 4. Start the daemon

### Option A: systemd (recommended for daily use)

```bash
stratosync daemon enable --now           # start now and on every login
stratosync daemon status                 # check it's running
stratosync daemon logs --follow          # follow logs
```

The `stratosync daemon` subcommand is a thin wrapper over `systemctl --user`
and `journalctl --user-unit=…` for the `stratosyncd.service` unit; the raw
`systemctl --user enable --now stratosyncd` etc. work just as well.

> **Don't enable `PrivateTmp=true` or `NoNewPrivileges=true` in the unit file.**
> `PrivateTmp` creates a private mount namespace that hides the FUSE mount from
> every other process; `NoNewPrivileges` blocks the setuid `fusermount3` binary
> from performing the mount. The shipped service unit intentionally omits both.

> **Journal storage gotcha.** If `/var/log/journal/` doesn't exist on your
> system, journald is in volatile mode: per-user services log fine, but their
> entries land in the system journal rather than a per-user journal file.
> That makes the common `journalctl --user -u stratosyncd` form report
> "No journal files were found", which is misleading — the logs are flowing,
> just not where that command looks. `stratosync daemon logs` (and
> `journalctl --user-unit=stratosyncd.service`) work either way. To enable
> persistent journals so both forms work and logs survive reboots:
> ```bash
> sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal
> sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal
> sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
> ```

### Option B: foreground (for development / debugging)

```bash
RUST_LOG=stratosync=debug stratosyncd
```

Either way, your cloud files are now available at the configured mount path:

```bash
ls ~/GoogleDrive/
```

For day-to-day commands (`status`, `dashboard`, `conflicts`, `pin`, `versions`, …), see the **[usage guide](usage.md)**.

---

## Uninstalling

```bash
stratosync daemon disable --now       # or: systemctl --user disable --now stratosyncd
fusermount3 -u ~/GoogleDrive          # unmount each configured mount
rm -rf ~/.config/stratosync ~/.cache/stratosync ~/.local/share/stratosync

# If installed via package:
sudo apt remove stratosync   # or dnf, pacman, etc.

# If installed via install.sh:
rm -f ~/.local/bin/stratosync ~/.local/bin/stratosyncd ~/.local/bin/stratosync-tray
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/stratosyncd.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Removing `~/.cache/stratosync` deletes the local content cache; remote data is
untouched. Removing `~/.local/share/stratosync` deletes the per-mount SQLite
databases (file index, version history, change tokens) — the daemon will re-
populate from the remote on next start.
